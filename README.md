## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript/HTML DOM



### Continued development

I'm looking to improve the "responsiveness" of the page - i.e. how well it works on different screen sizes, as the page does look a little asymmetrical on some resolutions. For example, on a taller desktop screen, the bottom half of the screen would be rather sparse.

### Useful resources
